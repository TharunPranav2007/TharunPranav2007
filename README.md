### 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I’m a highly motivated Computer Science Engineering student with a deep passion for data, analytics, and AI-driven problem-solving. I love uncovering patterns, transforming raw datasets into meaningful insights, and building intelligent applications that create real-world impact.  

My journey toward becoming a **Data Scientist** is fueled by curiosity and a desire to understand how data influences decisions, enhances efficiency, and powers intelligent systems. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, EDA, and machine learning, I enjoy exploring complete data workflows—from preprocessing and analysis to visualization and model deployment.  

I constantly challenge myself through projects, internships, and certifications to strengthen both my technical expertise and analytical mindset. My long-term goal is to create scalable, data-driven solutions that help organizations innovate, make smarter decisions, and unlock the true potential of their data.
