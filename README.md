## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I’m a highly motivated Computer Science Engineering student with a strong passion for data, analytics, and AI-driven solutions. I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building intelligent applications that create real-world impact.  

My journey toward becoming a **Data Scientist** is fueled by curiosity and a desire to explore how data influences decisions, enhances efficiency, and powers modern technology. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, EDA, and machine learning, I love working across the entire data lifecycle—cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and deploying models.  

I constantly challenge myself through projects, internships, and certifications to strengthen my technical expertise and analytical mindset. I aspire to build scalable, data-driven systems that help organizations innovate and unlock deeper insights from their data.
